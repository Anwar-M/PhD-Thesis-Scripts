Matlab scripts for processing and visualizing results used in my thesis

The Matlab scripts for (visualization) results seen in my thesis can probably be found in this repository. Most scripts consist of batch processing, which outputs several .fig or .eps files. These can not be run standalone (because data is missing) but serves as an example.

Most scripts requires the files contained in the Acoustic-Beamforming repository.
